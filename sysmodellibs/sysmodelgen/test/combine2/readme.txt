Test:
This tests using changing levels when merging system definitions. 
The first sysdef has only components and collections. The second has the structure down to the
level of collections (ie no components). The merged should look like a normal system model (no hidden layers)
with the number of levels in each layer (from top to bottom) being: 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 1, 3.


Differences:

All components in the file generated by the ini should be grey.
