Tests:
- Legend examples (only in model.xml, not ini).
- Global custom patterns in Shapes XML file.
- special functions in rules in Shapes XML
	* VARIABLE(): radial-grad pattern for any component with 3 binaries
	* VARIABLE(): thick border for any component in a tech stream with less than 12 total components
	* VERSION(): Dashed border for any component introduced after the model version.


Differences:

model-output.svg shows three examples at the end of the legend (not available in ini file). Also shows thick border on any component belonging to a techstream with fewer than 12 components (Cannot atatch techstream files from ini file).
