Cone development
================
This page should describe all relevant information on any developer who has or will create any functionality on
top of the ConE functionality.


ConE is open source
-------------------

ConE is a open source project (Currently under Eclipse Public License v1.0), which can take contributions from anyone interested in ConE. In future the ConE 
will propably be split to two separate parts; core and plugins. The core of ConE is mainly the public interface
and the storage agnostic functionality of ConE. This core part is intended to be more generic and functional on 
any platform. The plugin part is meant for extensions of ConE that could be for example platform specific 
implementation plugins that generate output files based on the configurations.
